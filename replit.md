# Sklep BHP - E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

Sklep BHP is a B2B/B2C e-commerce platform specializing in occupational health and safety equipment. The application provides a full-featured online store for industrial safety gear, work clothing, protective footwear, and personal protective equipment. Built with a modern TypeScript stack, it features a React-based frontend with a utility-focused design system and an Express backend with PostgreSQL database storage.

The platform supports product browsing, shopping cart functionality, order management, and user authentication with admin capabilities. The design emphasizes clarity, trust, and efficiency while maintaining industrial aesthetics through a black, yellow, and white color scheme.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and API interactions
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

**UI Component System:**
- Shadcn/ui components (Radix UI primitives) configured in "new-york" style
- Custom design tokens defined in CSS variables for theming
- Component aliases configured for clean imports (@/components, @/lib, etc.)

**State Management Strategy:**
- Local cart state managed in App.tsx with localStorage persistence
- Server state cached and synchronized via React Query
- Form state handled by React Hook Form with Zod validation

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Single-page application with client-side routing for smooth navigation
- Component composition pattern using Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Utility-first CSS approach with custom design system extending Tailwind
- Mobile-responsive design with breakpoint-aware components

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript for type-safe API development
- ESM modules throughout the codebase
- Custom middleware for request logging and error handling

**Data Layer:**
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- PostgreSQL as the primary database (configured for Neon serverless)
- Schema-first approach with Zod validation integration
- In-memory storage fallback (MemStorage) for development/testing

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints organized by resource (/api/products, /api/orders, /api/auth)
- Request validation using Zod schemas derived from Drizzle tables
- JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions
- Bcrypt for password hashing

**Key Architectural Patterns:**
- Repository pattern abstracted through IStorage interface
- Dependency injection ready (storage can be swapped between memory/database)
- Middleware pipeline for cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling)
- Environment-based configuration for development vs. production

### Authentication & Authorization

**Implementation:**
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Bcrypt password hashing (bcryptjs) with salt rounds
- User roles (isAdmin flag) for admin functionality
- Token-based session management stored in localStorage on client
- Protected routes and API endpoints based on authentication status

### Build & Deployment Strategy

**Development:**
- Vite HMR for fast frontend iteration
- tsx for running TypeScript server code directly
- Concurrent development server setup with Vite middleware

**Production:**
- Frontend: Vite build outputs to dist/public
- Backend: esbuild bundles server code to dist/index.js
- Single Node.js process serves both static files and API
- Environment variable configuration for database URLs and secrets
